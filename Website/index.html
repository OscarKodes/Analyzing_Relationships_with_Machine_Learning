            <p>
                What can we learn about relationships by using machine learning for exploratory analysis?
                <br><br>
                The dataset was taken from a Stanford University survey called, "<a
                    href="https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst2017">How Couples Meet and Stay Together 2017</a>." This
                dataset contains many variables including age, education level, political party, income, usage of dating
                apps, and quality of relationship (as self-rated by the subject). To prepare this data for analysis, I
                renamed and recoded a few features. The specific cleaning steps I took can be seen in this <a
                    href="">Jupyter notebook</a>. During the cleaning process, I also consulted this <a
                    href="https://stacks.stanford.edu/file/druid:vt073cc9067/HCMST_2017_fresh_Codeboodk_v1.1a.pdf">codebook</a>.
            </p>

            <div class="bullet-list">
                For this project, I had a few general research questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Can any features in this dataset help predict a subject's relationship quality rating?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do couples that meet on dating apps have higher or lower quality relationships?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What insights can I derive from using machine learning for exploratory analysis?
                    </li>

                I analyzed this dataset by creating four notebooks where I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis,
                Classification,
                Regression,
                and Principal Component Analysis.

                <p>
                    In Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the data is represented by principal components. PCA searches
                    for the areas in the dataset that have the most variation and creates an "axis"
                    for it. This axis with high variance is called a pricipal component. PCA is a great way to reduce
                    the number of dimensions in a dataset without losing too much information.

                    <br><br>
                    PCA also sorts its components from most to least variance captured, so a decent way to visualize a
                    high-diemensional dataset on a 2D plane is by using the first two components as X and Y axes.

                    <br><br>

                    For my PCA analysis, I took only the top features from the final classificatoin and regression
                    models to make interpretation simpler.

                    <br><br>

                    PCA components as axes on a plot can be difficult to interpret because they take in information from
                    many different features.
                    Visualizing the components on a heatmap first might help interpretation.
                </p>



                <!-- D3 VIS GOES BELOW HERE -->

                <div id="heatmap-vis" class="vis">
                    <h3>
                        Feature Contributions to Components 1 & 0
                    </h3>
                </div>

                <!-- D3 VIS GOES ABOVE HERE -->



                <p>
                    The color of each feature shows how it contributes to that component's variance and how they relate
                    to one another for that specific component. This can be used to help interpret a plot where the axes
                    are components 0 and 1.

                    <br><br>
                    The grey colored rectangles show that a feature does not contribute much to a
                    component's variance.

                    <br><br>
                    A yellow colored feature shows that it is positive, so when you increase on this component's axis,
                    you will get more of that feature.

                    <br><br>
                    For example, Component 0 has the number of household minors colored in yellow, so as you go forward
                    on this axis, the subjects tend to have more children at home.

                    <br><br>
                    A black colored feature shows that it is negative, so when you increase on this component's axis,
                    you will get less of that feature.

                    <br><br>
                    For
                    example, Component 0 has the partner's age colored in black, so as you go forward on this axis, the
                    cases tend to have younger partners.

                    <br><br>

                    The most useful parts of the heat map are:
                    <br>
                    Component 0:
                    <br>
